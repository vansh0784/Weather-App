# Weather App

A simple weather application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to display the current weather of any city. This project helps enhance understanding of working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.

---

## Features

- **Search Weather by City**: Enter a city name to get the current weather details.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches real-time weather data using a weather API.
- **Dynamic UI**: Displays weather conditions with appropriate icons and background changes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the application.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use a live server extension in VS Code.

## How It Works

1. Enter the city name in the search bar.
2. The app sends a request to the weather API to fetch data.
3. The weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions are displayed dynamically on the page.

---

## API Integration

- This app uses the **[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)** to fetch weather data.
- To use the app with your own API key:
  1. Sign up at OpenWeatherMap and get your API key.
  2. Replace the placeholder `API_KEY` in the `script.js` file with your actual API key:
     ```javascript
     const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
     ```
